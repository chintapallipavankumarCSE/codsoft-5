FACE RECOGNITION BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM, With a variety of features, this project's complete face recognition-based attendance system tracks attendance effectively. There are two modules in the system:

Module 1: Welcome Page[LOGIN] User authentication: By entering their email address and password, users can log in. Enables new users to register and establish an account. Password Recovery: Using the security questions they choose when registering, users can reset their password. Module 2: Attendance and Face Recognition Important System Features:

Student Information Add, examine, modify, update, or remove student data. Present student records in a tabular manner.

Face Detection: Use a webcam to record photos in real time, then preprocess them (resizing, greyscale). Use face detection and recognition technologies such as DNN and Haarcascade. Compare faces to previously stored photos to retrieve student information (ID, name, department, and roll number).

Participation[ATTENDENCE]: Use timestamps to automatically record attendance for faces that are recognised. Present attendance data and produce reports in Excel. Make a slip for those who are in attendance, and notify those who are not in attendance via email.

Help Point: Integrated email support mechanism for users to submit questions.

Train Information: Utilising previously taken pictures, train the model, add fresh student data, and save the model.

Images: Take, store, and organise student images for facial recognition.

Developer Details: Show developer details, project information, and tool credit information.

Leave: A confirmation prompt upon secure program termination verifies that all data is saved.

Extra Elements: Slip Generation: For people who are here now. Email Notification: Send absent pupils emails automatically.
